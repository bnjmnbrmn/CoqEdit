INSTALLATION STEPS:

1) Create the following two symbolic links in the same directory as build.xml:
	a) "jEdit_Install", linking to the directory containing jedit.jar.
	
	(On Mac OSX, for example, this might be:
	ln -s /Applications/jEdit.app/Contents/Resources/Java/ jEdit_Install
	)
	
	b) "jEdit_Settings", linking to the jEdit settings directory, which can 
	be found by opening jEdit and going to Utilities -> Settings Directory.
	
	(On Mac OSX, for example, this might be:
	ln -s ~/Library/jEdit/ jEdit_Settings
	)

2) Edit "CoqEdit.props".  The property "options.coqedit.coqtoppath" needs to be
set to the full path for coqtop.
(On Mac OSX, for example, this might be:
options.coqedit.coqtoppath=/Applications/CoqIdE_8.4.app/Contents/Resources/bin/coqtop
)

3) Run "ant" in the build.xml directory. This has been tested using Apache
Ant(TM) version 1.8.4.

4) Add Coq Vernacular highlighting.  This is a two step process:
	a) Copy the coq.xml into jEdit_Settings/modes/
	(  e.g.
	cp coq.xml ./jEdit_Settings/modes/ 
	)
	b) Add the following line to jEdit_Settings/modes/catalog, between the
	<MODES> and </MODES> tags:
	<MODE NAME="coq" FILE="coq.xml" FILE_NAME_GLOB="*.v" />
	

	
TO RUN:

In jEdit, go to Plugins -> Plugin Manager... and check the CoqEdit.jar checkbox. 
(You can uncheck and recheck this checkbox to reload the plugin.)  To get the
output panels to appear, you can now go to Plugins -> CoqEdit -> Show CoqEdit
Output Panel.  

You may have to dock this on the right side of the jEdit window
by clicking on the downward pointing triangle in the top left corner.  You may
also have to adjust the ratio of space given to the top and bottom panes by
dragging the small dot between the two.

To add shortcuts to the CoqEdit plugin menu options, go to Utilities -> Global
Options... and then click on "Shortcuts" in the panel on the left.  (The Filter
box is very helpful here.)
